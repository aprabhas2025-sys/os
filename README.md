# os-Simulation of Priority-Preemptive and C-SCAN Algorithms
The Priority-Preemptive scheduling simulation demonstrates how the CPU always executes the process with the highest priority and preempts the current process when a higher-priority process arrives.
The C-SCAN disk scheduling simulation shows how the disk head moves in one direction, services requests, and returns to the beginning, ensuring uniform waiting time and fair disk access.
